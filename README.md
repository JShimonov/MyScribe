# MyScribe

Although COVID cases have been decreasing all over, there are many students who are still taking classes remotely. Though that may seem great for the students, the attention span for many is very short, especially online. Luckily for students, most professors record their lectures and upload them online. However, even if you start rewatching those lectures at 1.5x speed, you are still stuck watching a lecture for 45 minutes, and that's only one lecture. 

This is where MyScribe steps in. With this app, you'll be able to upload your lectures and have them transcribed for you in less than a minute. It gets better though; you'll be able to jump to any timestamp in the video where a key word is mentioned and start from there.
* These features are currently being implemented

## Tech Stack
* Python
* GCS
  *   Speech-to-text
  *   Storage

In the future iterations of this application, we hope to implement Natural Language Processing to pin-point important moments in a lecture
